2014-02-04 - Version 0.2.0

Summary:

It's been a long time since the previous release and the LVM module has seen a
lot of community development.  It now supports AIX, thanks to Craig Dunn, and
grew an enormous number of facts, properties, and parameters.  There's a
fistful of bugfixes too which should help RHEL5 users.

Features:
 - A new `lvm_support` fact was added. 
 - A new `lvm_vgs` fact was added.
 - A new `lvm_pvs` fact was added.
 - Dynamic facts were added for lvm_vg_N and lvm_pv_N.
 - Support for lvcreate -l argument (extents)
 - Added AIX providers for logical_volume and filesystem types.
 - Use ensure_resources to handle multiple physical_volume in a volume_group.
 - Add XFS online resizing support.
 - Add `initial_size` property.
 - Add `extents` property.
 - Add `stripes` property.
 - Add `stripsize` property.
 - Huge number of parameters were added, most AIX only.

Bugfixes:
- Fix messages with new_size variables in logical_volume/lvm.rb
- size 'undef' doesn't work when creating a new logical volume
- resize2fs isn't called during resizing on ruby>1.
- Allow for physical_volumes and volume_groups that change as system lives.
- On RHEL 5 family systems ext4 filesystems can not be resized using resize2fs.
- Suppress facter warnings on systems that don't support LVM.
